# Advanced Data Analysis and Visualization

## ðŸ“– Overview

This repository showcases the implementation of five data analysis and visualization tasks completed during a data-focused Project. The project emphasizes advanced techniques in data preprocessing, analysis, and visualization, using Python and its powerful libraries. Each task highlights practical solutions to real-world problems, ensuring high-impact results and actionable insights.

## ðŸš€ Tasks

## 1. Time Series Analysis with Pandas

Perform advanced time-series analysis to uncover trends and patterns in data.

Dataset: Simulated dataset based on the Titanic Dataset from Kaggle.

Key Steps:


Added a Date column to simulate time-series data.

Resampled data for weekly average calculations.

Applied rolling statistics (mean, standard deviation) for trend analysis.

Created lagging features for time-based dependency visualization.

Generated line plots to visualize trends.

Output: Insights into time-series trends with actionable visualizations.


## 2. Custom Colormap for Matplotlib

Create visually differentiated plots with a custom colormap.

Dataset: 
Wine Quality Dataset.

Key Steps:


Built a custom colormap using ListedColormap from Matplotlib.

Visualized feature relationships (e.g., fixed acidity vs. volatile acidity) color-coded by wine quality.

Generated a heatmap for feature correlation analysis using Seaborn.

Output: 
Improved clarity in data representation and actionable insights into wine quality.


## 3. Visualizing High-Dimensional Data

Explore and visualize high-dimensional data effectively.

Dataset: 
Iris Dataset.

Key Steps:
